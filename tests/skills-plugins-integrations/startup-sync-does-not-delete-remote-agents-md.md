### Feature: Startup sync does not delete remote AGENTS.md

This test covers explicitly initiated manual synchronization. Application startup and local Skills changes never invoke it; `CODEX_HOME/AGENTS.md` is not replaced or linked automatically.


#### Prerequisites
- Skills sync configured to `friuns2/codexskills`.
- Remote `main` contains `AGENTS.md`.
- Local skills repo is clean before startup sync.

#### Steps
1. Confirm remote `AGENTS.md` exists on `main`.
2. Confirm local `~/.codex/skills` is clean.
3. Trigger `Startup Sync`.
4. After completion, inspect latest commit created by sync (if any).
5. Verify `AGENTS.md` still exists locally and in remote `origin/main`.

#### Expected Results
- Startup sync may update manifest, but must not delete `AGENTS.md`.
- If sync creates a commit, changed files do not include `D AGENTS.md`.
- Local and remote `AGENTS.md` hashes remain equal after sync.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- None.
